# The shim-review project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Several of these interactions
and contributions have been described below in-depth in the context of
the shim-review project specifically.

Our diverse community, including applicants and reviewers, consists of
people with different backstories and, as mentioned, different
experiences. Not everyone has the knowledge to publish an error-free
application the first time.  Furthermore, not everyone follows the
development of UEFI Shim, bootloaders, the Linux kernel, SSL libraries,
signing utilities, among others, and we as individuals or companies may
not be aware of the venues that take place outside the shim-review
project. It's natural and there's nothing to be ashamed about.  We're
here to partake in a venue where we all can learn from the public
applications in a safe space to make mistakes. After all, it's better to
make them and correct them here, than send a submission to the Microsoft
Windows Hardware Developer Program, only to have it rejected there -
while the reviewing process should be strict and require asking detailed
questions to ensure that submission will be error-free, the venue should
not be interpreted as a public administration office with overwhelming
bureaucracy, where the reviews are being done with discouragement and
burnout. As a welcoming community, we would like to avoid something like
an applicant having to, sadly, attend Daily Standups, Plannings,
Retrospectives, among others, only to once again explain with utter
sadness to the management, that "*We don't have this application
accepted, since the committee has not yet reviewed it*" - it's
preferable that it (both the community and the project) resembles a student
club at a university with loose atmosphere, where people from different
cultures, experiences, and having different levels of knowledge and expertise
can come and safely learn new things.

The aforementioned inclusion shall also relate to the fact that, while
many applicants and reviewers may have a high-end technology that clones
a repository and performs a build of a binary in mere seconds, this is
not always the case. The reviewers may work with a limited (speed or
transfer-wise) Internet connection, disk space, processing power, and
other resources. Furthermore, while this project is endorsed by the
[Microsoft Corporation](Microsoft-file-signing-reqs) and [Red Hat, Inc.
("Red Hat Bootloader Team")](rhboot), the reviewers are in most cases
volunteers working on this in their free time, rather than employees
being paid to review the applications during their working hours.
Sometimes this volunteer work means sacrificing sleep time or neglecting
friends and family just so the reviewing process gets uncloged.

While it's understandable to desire more public activity, the lack of it
does not mean that nothing is going on behind the scenes, and even if a
reviewer appears to be slacking off, it may well mean that they are
preparing a decent response, which can take time and energy. Commenting
in an application may require thorough research and composing an
easy-to-follow response, rather than pasting facts without a good
structure/flow. Furthermore, it may require some interest in the product
being reviewed itself, for which the UEFI Shim will be prepared, and its
general surroundings, e.g. building frameworks, what the company behind
a product does, among others. This also requires time and focus, which
may be hard to come by if a reviewer gets little sleep due to a busy
life. As humans, we may well have personal struggles that make focusing
on analysis hard or be unavailable due to multiple circumstances and
interruptions, including the fact that there may be timezone
differences, due to this venue being and international one.

For example, if you follow a reviewer on social media, and they post
goofy things there, but the reviews are stalled, that's **not** an
indicator of whether someone is slacking off or not, because, for
instance, during long calls or after some sleepless days, one can write
a loose comment publicly, but can't focus on reviews that require
accuracy and correctness.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
