# HSM Hardware Compatibility List

This directory is meant to be a community-backed registry of HSMs proven to work well for signing bootloader components, along with the infrastructure setup workarounds that are required for certain problematic tokens.

This venue is **not** meant to act as any form of endorsement or advertisement for the aforementioned tokens and their vendors.
